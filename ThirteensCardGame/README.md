PROJECT TITLE: Thirteens Card Game 

Last modified: 13th March, 2017

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: ( Top-Down Development/ Object-Oriented Approach) 
* Create an abstract board class for inheritance
* Create a Card class and create mutator methods and comparison methods 
that can be specifically used on Card objects.
* Create a Deck class. We will use this to create a deck of cards, keep track of the
dealt cards and undealt cards, as well as shuffle and deal cards.
* Create a GUI class to provide GUI for the game Thirteens. 
* Lastly, create a driver class to run and start the game by first creating a a ThirteensBoard object. 
       

AUTHORS: 
* Chris Jim (However, I did not contribute to the making of the GUI class and I did not make the game rules) 
* Randy Rasa
* Elevens Lab(College Board) optional portion. 
 

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
* Run the game on IDEs such as bluejay.

Game Rules:
 *This game uses a 10-card board.

  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
 *Pairs of cards whose point values add up to 13 are selected and removed.
