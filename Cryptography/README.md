 
 # Encrypt&DecryptwithKey.java
 
 ## DESCRIPTION:
 * Encrypting and decrypting message using an algorithm that takes a int array of keys.
 * This program uses an algorithm that adds ASCI value to char base on the values of key arr.
 * For example: A becomes C when val 2 is added.
 * If length of message is longer than key arr, key arr can be reused over and over again until message is fully decrypted.
 * Uppercase letters will remain uppercase, same goes for lowercase letters.
